		<p>2) NABH Nursing Excellence Certification Award - 2015<br>Nursing services are an integral part of the clinical services of any health care organization. The aim of nursing services is to provide comprehensive nursing care in terms of health promotion, prevention of diseases and therapeutic nursing care to the patients in a HCO as well as to the community.


			The objective of the nursing professional is to provide safe, competent and ethical nursing care with compassion, comfort and 
			collaboration with the patients, the family, the community and the clinical care team. The Nursing professionals are the cornerstone 
			of any quality related programme in a health care organization since most of the delivery and monitoring of health care is carried out 
			by them. Their knowledge, clinical judgement, skills, attitude, 
			communication and other soft skills thus make all the difference in the ultimate delivery of health care to the patients.</p>
